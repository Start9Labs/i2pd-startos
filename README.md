> Everything not listed in this document should behave the same as upstream
> I2Pd. If a feature, setting, or behavior is not mentioned here, the
> upstream documentation is accurate and fully applicable.

Peer-to-peer network for I2P services and decentralized applications. Run I2P
services (.b32.i2p addresses) to make your installed apps accessible over the
I2P network. Provides SOCKS and HTTP proxies for accessing I2P addresses, and
can optionally operate as a floodfill node to support the network.

## Image and Container Runtime

| Property      | Value                                         |
| ------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| Base image    | Alpine Linux edge with upstream `i2pd` package |
| Architectures | x86_64, aarch64, riscv64                      |
| Command       | `i2pd --conf=/var/lib/i2pd/etc/i2pd/i2pd.conf --datadir=/var/lib/i2pd` |
| User          | `i2pd` (non-root)                              |

The image is minimal, just Alpine + the `i2pd` package. No custom patches
or modifications to the I2Pd binary.

---

## Volume and Data Layout

| Volume    | Mount Point     | Contents                                               |
| --------- | --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| `i2pd`    | `/var/lib/i2pd` | I2P data directory, tunnel keys, config files          |

The single source of truth for all settings is `config.json` on the `i2pd`
volume (a zod-typed file model). The native `i2pd.conf` and `tunnels.conf`
files under `etc/i2pd/` on the volume are write-only artifacts regenerated
from `config.json` on every start, on init, and after every action; i2pd is
pointed at them via `--conf`, and `tunnels.conf` changes are hot-reloaded
through the web console without a restart.

I2P tunnel keys are stored under
`/var/lib/i2pd/tunnels/<packageId>/<hostId>/tunnel_<index>/`.

---

## Installation and First-Run Flow

1. No setup wizard or credentials -- I2Pd starts immediately with SOCKS and
   HTTP proxies on ports 4447 and 4444 respectively.
2. I2P services (tunnels) are added via the URL plugin (see below).
3. **Bootstrap takes 3-10 minutes** for I2Pd to integrate into the I2P network.

---

## Configuration Management

All configuration is managed through StartOS actions and the URL plugin.
There is no upstream configuration UI.

| Setting               | Managed By  | Method                                      |
| --------------------- | ----------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| I2P tunnels (services)| URL plugin  | Add/remove via service interface URLs        |
| Router settings       | Action      | Configure Router                             |
| SOCKS proxy port      | Hardcoded   | Always `0.0.0.0:4447`                       |
| HTTP proxy port       | Hardcoded   | Always `0.0.0.0:4444`                       |
| Data directory        | Hardcoded   | Always `/var/lib/i2pd`                       |
| Web console           | Hardcoded   | `0.0.0.0:7070` (UI interface; also used for health checks and hot-reload) |
| SSU2 / NTCP2 ports    | Hardcoded   | `4450` (UDP) / `4451` (TCP)                  |
| SAM API port          | Hardcoded   | `0.0.0.0:7656` (host bridge only, not exported) |

## Network Access and Interfaces

### SOCKS Proxy (I2P network only)

- **Port:** 4447
- **Protocol:** SOCKS5
- **Purpose:** Access .b32.i2p addresses over the I2P network
- **Binding:** `0.0.0.0:4447` (accessible to other services and LAN)
- **Limitation:** Cannot be used as a general privacy proxy like Tor's SOCKS5

### HTTP Proxy (I2P network only)

- **Port:** 4444
- **Protocol:** HTTP
- **Purpose:** HTTP access to .b32.i2p addresses
- **Binding:** `0.0.0.0:4444` (accessible to other services and LAN)
- **Limitation:** Cannot be used as a general privacy proxy

### Router Console (web UI)

- **Port:** 7070
- **Type:** UI interface ("I2P Router Console")
- **Purpose:** Monitor and manage the I2P router (network status, tunnels, known routers)
- **Note:** `strictheaders` is disabled so the StartOS reverse proxy can reach it; authentication is handled by StartOS

### SAM API (bridge-only)

- **Port:** 7656
- **Purpose:** Lets another service on the server open I2P sessions through this router
- **Binding:** `0.0.0.0:7656`, bound with no exported interface — reachable only on `lo`/`lxcbr0`, resolvable by a consumer with `sdk.host.getBridgeAddress`
- **Note:** SAM is unauthenticated; exporting it as a service interface would put a control API on the LAN by default

### SSU2 / NTCP2 Transports (p2p)

- **Ports:** 4450 (SSU2, UDP) and 4451 (NTCP2, TCP)
- **Purpose:** Fixed inbound transport ports so consistent port-forwarding rules are possible; forwarding them on your router (plus setting **External IP / Hostname**) lets the router classify as directly reachable ("O-type")

### Floodfill Node (conditional)

- **Enabled via:** Configure Router action (Floodfill toggle)
- **Purpose:** Participate as a floodfill node to support the I2P network
- **Only active when floodfill is enabled in Configure Router**

---

## Actions (StartOS UI)

### Configure Router

- **ID:** `configure-router`
- **Visibility:** Enabled (user-facing)
- **Purpose:** Configure I2P router settings
- **Availability:** Any status
- **Inputs:**
  - **Floodfill** -- participate as a floodfill node (default: off; requires ≥ Standard bandwidth)
  - **Bandwidth** -- Low (32 KB/s), Standard (256 KB/s), High (full speed), Unlimited (default: Standard)
  - **Transit Tunnels** -- relay traffic for other I2P users (default: on)
  - **Log Level** -- none / error / warn / info / debug (default: warn)
  - **External IP / Hostname** -- published in RouterInfo instead of peer-test auto-detection (fixes Symmetric NAT classification under double-NAT; optional)
  - **Custom Reseed URL** -- HTTPS su3 reseed endpoint used instead of the default reseed servers (optional)
- **Effect:** Rewrites `i2pd.conf`/`tunnels.conf` and restarts the service (`i2pd.conf` is not hot-reloadable)

### Add I2P Tunnel (hidden)

- **ID:** `add-i2p-tunnel`
- **Visibility:** Hidden (invoked by the URL plugin, not directly by users)
- **Purpose:** Add an I2P server tunnel for a specific service interface URL
- **Inputs:**
  - **SSL** -- whether to serve with SSL (hidden if interface doesn't support it)
  - **Address** -- choose an existing .b32.i2p address or create a new one

### Delete I2P Tunnel (hidden)

- **ID:** `delete-i2p-tunnel`
- **Visibility:** Hidden (invoked by the URL plugin)
- **Purpose:** Remove a specific port binding from an I2P tunnel; deletes
  the entire .b32.i2p address and keys if no port bindings remain

---

## URL Plugin

I2P registers as a `url-v0` plugin, which integrates with the StartOS
interface URL system. This allows users to add/remove .b32.i2p addresses for
any service's interface directly from the service's URL table.

- **Table action:** `add-i2p-tunnel` -- appears in the URL table for all services
- **Remove action:** `delete-i2p-tunnel` -- attached to each exported .b32.i2p URL
- **Stale cleanup:** On init, entries referencing interfaces that no longer
  exist are automatically removed along with their key material

---

## Backups and Restore

- **Backed up:** Entire `i2pd` volume (I2P tunnel keys, config files)
- **Restore behavior:** Volume-level restore; I2P tunnel keys are preserved,
  so .b32.i2p addresses survive backup/restore cycles.
- **Uninstall warning:** Uninstalling I2P permanently deletes all I2P tunnel
  keys and .b32.i2p addresses.

---

## Health Checks

- **Method:** Liveness check against the i2pd web console on `127.0.0.1:7070`
- **States:**
  - **Loading** -- "I2Pd is starting up" (connection refused; console not open yet)
  - **Success** -- "I2Pd is running" (console responds 200)
  - **Failure** -- "I2Pd is not responding" (timeout) / "I2Pd HTTP API error" (non-200)
- **Timeout:** 5 seconds per check
- **Note:** This is a daemon-liveness check, not a network-integration check.
  Full integration into the I2P network takes **3-10 minutes** after the check
  reports success (an install alert sets this expectation for the user)

---

## Limitations and Differences

1. **I2P-network-only proxies.** SOCKS and HTTP proxies only work for .b32.i2p
   addresses, not as general privacy proxies like Tor's SOCKS5.
2. **Longer bootstrap time.** Integration into the I2P network takes 3-10
   minutes vs. 30 seconds for Tor.
3. **Floodfill, not relay/bridge.** I2P uses floodfill nodes instead of Tor's
   relay/bridge architecture.
4. **SAM is bridge-only.** The SAM (Simple Anonymous Messaging) API is bound so
   other services on the server can reach it over the host bridge, but it is not
   exported as a service interface, so it is never reachable from the LAN,
   clearnet, or Tor.

---

## What Is Unchanged from Upstream

- I2Pd binary is the upstream Alpine package, unmodified
- I2P tunnel protocol behavior
- I2P network bootstrap and peer discovery
- Floodfill node participation
- SOCKS proxy protocol (for I2P addresses)
- HTTP proxy protocol (for I2P addresses)
